Pentesting Cheat Sheet
======================

This security cheat sheet is a collection of tips and tricks to assist pentesters in testing applications and networks.

### Usage

The cheat sheet is broken down into logical directory structures as much as possible. However, it might be too difficult to browse through the directories looking for the right thing. The best way to find relevant content is to use the Github search above which searches through file contents.

For example, if you want to find out how to verify a TLS CRIME vulnerability, simply type __CRIME__ in the search above.

### Contributing

Feel free to contribute a note that you think might be handy for your fellow pentesters. There's no rules per se but ensure your notes can be picked up by someone who has very little to no knowledge about the topic.
